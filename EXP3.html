        <h2>Cyber Security Knowledge Mission</h2>
        <p>The pioneering technologies of internet of things, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and data science have made our dependence on the cyber world irreversible. This dependency on the cyber world has opened new avenues for data breach and has made the cyber world vulnerable to crimes and attack. KITS has launched this new mission to secure cyber space and monitor potential attacks by adopting essential technologies in building and protecting systems using cyber security tools with required automation, machine learning and threat intelligence.</p>
